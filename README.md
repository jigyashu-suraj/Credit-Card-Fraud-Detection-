# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection :
Here i have choosen a dataset from kaggle website and my job is to predict whether the transition is valid or fraud .

## Dataset :
Source : https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and
more background information about the data. Features V1, V2, â€¦ V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are
'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount,
this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-senstive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.

## FLow of project :
Here we have done two methods to predict the outcome . The first one is by appling machine learning algorithm and the second one is by appling deep learning algorithm .
The data pre-processing technique is samiliar for both of the method . I have scaled the amount column and deleted the duplicated column . 
In the 1st method i have applied Random forest algorithm to classify the data and in the second method I have built a deep learning model and feed the data to predict the outcome
.
